<h1>Common Classification Algorithm</h1>

1. **Logistic Regression**: Despite its name, logistic regression is a linear classification algorithm used for binary classification tasks. It models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using a logistic function.

2. **Decision Trees**: Decision trees recursively split the data into subsets based on the features that best separate the classes. They are intuitive and can handle both binary and multiclass classification tasks.

3. **Random Forest**: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions through averaging or voting. It improves the accuracy and robustness of the model compared to individual decision trees.

4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates the classes in the feature space. It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and can handle both linear and non-linear classification tasks through the use of kernel functions.

5. **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: KNN is a simple and intuitive classification algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority class among their k nearest neighbors in the feature space. It is non-parametric and lazy-learning, meaning it doesn't make assumptions about the underlying data distribution during training.

6. **Naive Bayes**: Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem and the assumption of independence between features. Despite its simplicity, it often performs well on text classification and other high-dimensional datasets.

7. **Kernel SVM (Support Vector Machine)**: is an extension of the traditional SVM algorithm that allows for nonlinear decision boundaries by using kernel functions to map the input data into higher-dimensional feature spacesonstructing a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
